This is my dream web application. It is an application which people of two states can use it to see the Govt schemes being implemented. They can vote for their best representative for his work. User has the ability to like a Representative, write a review about the schemes, Governance and also review your representative. Currently this site is maintained by me and all the profiles for the representatives will be created. Later we are planning to make the representatives use their own profiles and update their daily activity and also the things they have done so far. 

Currently this app is being built and solely maintained by me.
